From your terminal, cd to the directory containing the 3 python scripts and the 1 bash script.

Execute the following three commands from your terminal:

python get_daily_data.py
# Inspect the files generated by the above command for interest sake.
# When using Python 3, it seems that the date keys in the dictionary are sorted chronologically by default (contrary to Python 2).  Because of this, sort_by_date.py is slightly reduntant, but still useful for getting data into a Pandas DataFrame.

bash loop_daily_data.sh

get_azm_data.py
